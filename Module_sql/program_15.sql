-- Event Session Time Conflict
-- Identify overlapping sessions within the same event (i.e., session start and end times that
-- conflict).
-- A self-join is when a table is joined with itself.

-- âœ… Why use it?
-- To compare rows within the same table, especially:

-- Compare one row with another row in the same table

-- Detect duplicates, overlaps, or relationships between rows
